This repository contains some R codes and markdown files that I wrote to practice the machine learning techniques learned from Caltech's [Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x), NTU's [Machine Learning Foundations (機器學習基石)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXVfgk9fNX2I7tB6oIINGBmW50rrmFTqf) and [Machine Learning Techniques (機器學習技法)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXVfgk9fNX2IQOYPmqjqWsNUFl2kpk1U2) and other online resources.

In these codes, I avoided using readily available packages in R as much as possible and wrote most of the algorithms from scratch. The algorithms practiced here include perception, binary and multinomial logistic regression, support vector machine, simple neural network and simple boosting.
