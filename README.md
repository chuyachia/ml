This repository contains some R codes and markdown files that I wrote to practice the machine learning techniques that I learned from Caltech's [Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x), NTU's [Machine Learning Foundations (機器學習基石)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXVfgk9fNX2I7tB6oIINGBmW50rrmFTqf) and [Machine Learning Techniques (機器學習技法)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXVfgk9fNX2IQOYPmqjqWsNUFl2kpk1U2), Stanford's [Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial) and other online resources. Its content will be updated as I learn new stuffs.
