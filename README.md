This repository contains some R codes and markdown files that I wrote to practice the machine learning techniques that I learned from the [Caltech Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x) online course, the [Stanford Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial) and other online ressources. Its content will be updated as I learn new stuffs.
